Acts As QA
==========

Acts_as_qa checks all the actions defined in application and checks the response if it is success or not.


Install as Gem
==============

Open your 'Gemfile' and add this line:

    gem 'acts_as_qa'

Now run:
	
		bundle install


Install as Plugin
==============

To install as plugin run:
	
	rails plugin install git@github.com:sapnasolutions/sapna-acts_as_qa.git
		
Use
====

Now run the rake task

		rake acts_as_qa:setup
	
This will add parameters for each action in a controller. This rake task also creates a new environment 'acts_as_qa'. this tack also add a before_filter in application_controller.rb so that user can be initialized. Now open each controller and modify parameters according to requirement of action.

format of the parameters:

		#QA :a => 'b'
		
so for show action for posts controller it will be:

		#QA :id => Post.first.id
		
Now open 'application_controller.rb' where you can see a piece of code:

		#Generated by acts as qa
	  before_filter :set_current_user_for_qa

	  def set_current_user_for_qa
	    if Rails.env=='acts_as_qa'
	      #session[:user_id]=1
	    end
	  end
	
This filter will set a user session for the action. So if you are using devise gem for authentication you can add following line in the code:

		session["warden.user.user.key"] = ["User", [15], "$2a$10$RSVEtVgr4UGwwnbGNPn9se"]

Now open 'database.yml' and modify it according to your requirement. Note that this will delete/edit the record from database. So do not use a database which you don't want to modify.
